	<p>If I could tell the world just one thing it would be<br>
	we're all okay,<br>
	and not to worry because worry is wastful and useles in times like these.<br>
	I wont be made useless or be idle with despeair<br>
	I will gather myself around my faith<br>
	for light does the <span style="text-shadow:5px 5px 8px darkgrey">darkness</span> most fear.<br>
	&nbsp;
	Poverty stole your <span style="color: gold; font-weight: bold">golden</span> shoes.<br>
	It didn't steal your laughter.<br>
	And heartache came to visit me<br>
	but I knew it wasn't ever after.<br>
	My hands are not yours<br>
	and I am never broken<br>
